🧠 Prompt Title:
“AI-Powered Smart Water Management and Prediction System”

🚀 Prompt Description:
Build an AI-powered data science project called “AquaMind” that monitors, analyzes, and predicts water usage in real-time using machine learning and intelligent analytics.

💧 Project Goals:

Simulate and analyze water consumption data for homes or industries.

Detect abnormal usage patterns or possible leaks using anomaly detection models.

Forecast future water demand using time-series ML models (LSTM, Prophet, or Regression).

Suggest personalized conservation tips based on user habits.

Display all insights on an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit or Flask.

🧩 Core Features to Implement:

Smart Data Simulation

Generate a dataset with attributes like date, time, temperature, humidity, flow rate, and total liters used.

Add random fluctuations to mimic real-world sensor noise.

Anomaly & Leak Detection

Use Isolation Forest or statistical thresholds to detect irregular flow rates.

Display warnings like “Leak Detected in Zone 3 – 2.5x normal usage.”

Predictive Analytics

Train ML models (LSTM or Random Forest) to predict daily/weekly water usage.

Compare predicted vs actual usage visually.

AI-based Recommendation System

Suggest conservation tips dynamically (e.g., “Reduce shower time by 3 minutes to save 25L daily”).

Use NLP-based summarization for generating friendly advice messages.

Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit / Flask)

Real-time charts: Daily usage, prediction graphs, anomaly alerts.

Smart assistant chat panel (using LangChain or ChatGPT API) to answer:
“How much water did I use last week?”
“When was my last anomaly alert?”

Bonus (Optional Advanced Features)

Integrate weather API to correlate rainfall and humidity with consumption.

Add water quality index prediction (pH, turbidity).

Export insights as PDF reports.

🧠 Tech Stack Recommendation:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Plotly, LangChain use the gemini api key for prediction and i need another one option is that i want to add the data also with label
